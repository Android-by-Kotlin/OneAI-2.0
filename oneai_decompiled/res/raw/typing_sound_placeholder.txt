# Typing Sound Effect Placeholder

To complete the JARVIS typing effect, you need to add a futuristic typing sound file here.

1. Find or create a short, futuristic typing/keyboard sound effect (0.1-0.2 seconds long)
   - Recommended: A soft, electronic "click" or "beep" sound
   - File format: MP3 or OGG

2. Name the file: typing_sound.mp3 (or typing_sound.ogg)

3. Place it in this directory (app/src/main/res/raw/)

4. The sound will automatically be played during the typing animation
